# K2 Metadata

***A collection of metadata files to aid target selection
and data analysis for NASA's K2 mission***

### Contents

This repository contains the following sets of metadata:
 * `tpf-index`: tables detailing the Target Pixel Files (TPF)
 that are served by MAST, including some basic metadata 
 (equatorial & pixel coordinates, channel numbers, etc)
 for each TPF file.
 * `footprint-coordinates`: equatorial coordinates of the CCD corners 
 for all K2 campaigns. This is useful for selecting targets
 or visualizing where K2 has pointed.
